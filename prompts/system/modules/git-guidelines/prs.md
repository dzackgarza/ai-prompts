## PRs

### Handling Review Feedback

**Reviewer comments require explicit action, not acknowledgment:**

- Never simply "acknowledge" a comment without code changes
- Every issue requires an explicit fix in an explicit commit
- If an issue is too large for the current PR (sweeping changes, touches many files), create a new PR specifically for that fix
- Never dismiss issues as "irrelevant", "out-of-scope", "won't-fix", or "acknowledged" without action
- Never pretend a PR is ready until all feedback has been explicitly addressed with code changes or new issues warranting new PRs

### What Qualifies as a PR

**PRs are for significant work only.** Do not use PRs for:

- Simple doc changes
- Trivial bugs or features easily implemented in 5-10 writes/edits
- One-off fixes that don't warrant review overhead

**PRs are appropriate for:**

- Entire features (dozens or hundreds of LOC changes)
- 10+ commits of substantive work
- Sensitive changes that might introduce regressions

PRs trigger rate-limited reviews — reserve them for changes where mistakes, regressions, or LLM failure modes are more likely.
