## Git Workflow

All work is in **noisy repos** with others' uncommitted changes.
Use `git add`/`git commit` for checkpoints.
**For any git operation: LOAD `git-guidelines` skill.**

## Why `git restore` and `git checkout` Are Banned

These commands silently discard changes without creating an audit trail.

**Instead of reverting state directly:**

1. Commit your current work (checkpoint)
2. `git diff` to identify the rollback point
3. Apply the reverse diff as a new commit

**New feature work:** PR-driven via the GitHub CLI.

## Delegating to Jules

For smaller, well-scoped issues with clear acceptance criteria — especially those that are easily verifiable (bug fixes, test additions, lint fixes, documentation) — consider delegating to Jules via GitHub issues.

**When appropriate:** straightforward tasks where the desired solution is already known, purely internal code changes, or work where research has already been done.

**When to avoid:** tasks requiring external API research, complex integration with unfamiliar libraries, or work likely to need repeated prompting.

Load the `jules` skill for the full workflow (create, monitor, review, feedback loop).
